      "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Liz Creek Cabin was built in 1929 in the remote backcountry as a Forest Service guard station and is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. An extensive restoration that was completed in 2014 brought the cabin back to life as a rental available to the public. The small single room cabin has a loft and a covered porch. Although there are several entry points to the area, the site is only accessible by the single track multi use portion of Weitas Creek trail #20 that connects 12-mile saddle to the North Fork of the Clearwater River. Visitors are strongly advised to consult the forest website, as well as a map prior to reserving or traveling to the cabin and to call the district information desk for any questions.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>While remote, this site offers a great chance to explore both riparian habitat and mountain vistas. Along with trail 20 a multi-use motorized trail, that is also open to ATV/UTV 50\" or less from 12 Mile Saddle to within approximately 1.5 miles of the cabin. There are several other trails in the vicinity that offer connection to a host of recreation opportunities to the avid outdoors adventurer with berry picking, hiking, biking, sightseeing, fishing and hunting being the most popular. Recreate responsibly, be sure to check the regulations and rules to educate yourself before you recreate by visiting https://idfg.idaho.gov/ and https://www.fs.usda.gov/news/nezperceclearwater/news-events for up to date information.<br></p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>While remote, this site offers a great chance to explore both riparian habitat and mountain vistas.

The forest beyond the cabinâs meadow varies from old growth conifer trees mixed with huge cedar snags from the great 1910 fires, to steep mountain sides filled with an abundance of vegetation, including Huckleberry, Mountain Maple, Thimble berry and alder. Weitas, and to a lesser extent Liz Creek, have multiple beaver dams unique to the area providing a water abundant habitat full of native flora/fauna, so visitors are likely to have several opportunities to catch a glimpse of the many species in the area. The cabin is an ideal base camp for those looking to reconnect with nature, or as a stopover for a variety of outdoor enthusiasts as they explore the district.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Depending on how you decide to travel into the cabin, there are many attractions along the way including the historic Lolo Motorway that stretches 100 miles through scenic mountain landscapes with spectacular views as it parallels a portion of the Lewis and Clark and the Nez Perce trails. Sites include but not limited to places such as; The Smoking Place, The Sinque Hole, and Spirit Revival Ridge. The North Fork ranger district prides itself on the diversity of world class recreational opportunities ranging from bird/wildlife watching, big game hunting, whitewater rafting, leisurely floats, secluded backpacking/equestrian trails into the high mountain backcountry, to motorized OHV/ ATV/UTV trail systems. These unique opportunities draw visitors from around the world and of all walks of life. Summer visitors also have the opportunity to observe meadows and hillsides blanketed in colorful wildflowers throughout much of the season. Travelers should be prepared for rough sometimes treacherous conditions. No services are located along this road so travelers should have plenty of gas, food, and water for the drive.</p>\n",
      "FacilityDirections": "<p>Liz Creek Cabin located in the <strong>very remote</strong> portion of the upper Weitas Creek drainage on the North Fork Ranger District of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest in Idaho, approximately 25 air miles due east of Pierce Idaho. Although there are several routes into the cabin, it is most accessible from US HWY 12 between Kooskia Idaho and Missoula Montana via FSR 107 and trail 20. Travel to the cabin after leaving US HWY 12 is on 16 miles of single lane, gravel surfaced roadways that may be peppered with large potholes/rocks that can be quite rough, even partially blocked with debris, and 11 miles of moderate difficulty, multi-use motorized trail open to vehicles 50\" or less, to within 1.5 miles of the cabin, the remaining portion of the trail is <strong>closed to ATV/UTV 50\" </strong>traffic and visitors must either hike or ride the remaining single track segment of the route. To plan their trip accordingly, visitors are strongly advised to consult a map, the forest web site, and seasonal conditions in advance of making reservations as well as prior to travel since there are no services on the forest.Â </p>\n<p>To approach the cabin via U.S HWY 12, locate FSR 107 at mile marker 139.7 approximately 25 miles west of Powell, Idaho. Follow FSR 107 twelve miles north to Saddle Camp Junction with roads FSR 500/FSR 587. Take a hard left on FSR 500 heading west. Follow FSR 500 4 miles to the 12 Mile Saddle trail head of trail 20. Follow the motorized, moderate difficulty, multi-use trail 20, 9.5 miles from 12 Mile Saddle to the pack bridge crossing at Weitas creek (trail 20 is <strong>closed to ATV/UTV</strong> traffic at this point). Continue following the motorized single-track, moderate difficulty, multi-use portion of the trail 20 for the remaining 1.5 miles to the cabin.Â Â </p>\n<p>*NOTE: All mileages given are an approximation. Seasonal conditions in the early spring/late fall can be challenging in this high elevation remote area. Conditions on FSR 500 between 12 Mile Saddle on the east end and Rocky Ridge Lake on the west end requires travel with <strong>high clearance 4X4</strong> vehicles with experienced operators. Trail 649 is a <strong>steep and arduous</strong> 3.5-mile hike with an elevation difference of approximately 2,500â feet.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>\n",
